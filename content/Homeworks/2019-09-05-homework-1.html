<p>Answer the questions below using your own data (for question 1) and the dataset from this file for the remaining questions:<a href="https://raw.github.com/josh-jackson/ALDA/master/Hw1" class="uri">https://raw.github.com/josh-jackson/ALDA/master/Hw1</a> If you have your own longitudinal data, please feel free to use that instead.</p>
<p>If using the provided dataset note that we are looking at depression across 5 waves during college. Waves are signified by a letter at the start of the variable name, starting with A, then B, then C, etcetera. Not all waves collected depression during college.</p>
<p>Please email your answers via a) an Rmd file and b) a pdf to: <a href="mailto:Homewor.dk7huzwn6n5aohka@u.box.com" class="email">Homewor.dk7huzwn6n5aohka@u.box.com</a> If you are using your own data please also attach the dataset.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create a codebook with an actual dataset you are working with (it does not need to be longitudinal). Feed it into R to change variable names.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a wide dataset (such as the provided one) and make it long</p></li>
<li><p>Run separate linear models on all of the participants subjects (a basic regression). What is the average intercept, the average slope?</p></li>
<li><p>Now run a mlm/lmer model with only a random intercept. What is the ICC? Interpret.</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce a fixed slope term. What is the difference in interpretation for the fixed effects estimates in this estimate and the previous? Of the residual standard error?</p></li>
<li><p>Run an additional model with a random slope. How does this change compare to the previous fixed slope model? Should you keep the random slope or not?</p></li>
<li><p>Interpret the correlation between the slope and the intercept.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a density plot of the random effects from your final model.</p></li>
</ol>
