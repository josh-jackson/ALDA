<p>##Now you try:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create a codebook with an actual dataset you are working with (it does not need to be longitudinal). Feed it into R to change variable names.</p></li>
<li><p>Take the wide dataset and make it long</p></li>
<li><p>Run separate linear models on all of the participants subjects (a basic regression). What is the average intercept, the average slope?</p></li>
<li><p>Now run a mlm/lmer model with only a random intercept. What is the ICC?</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce a fixed slope term. What is the difference in interpretation for the fixed effects estimates in this estimate and the previous? Of the residual standard error?</p></li>
<li><p>Run an additional model with a random slope. How does this change compare to the previous model? Should you keep the random slope or not?</p></li>
<li><p>Interpret the correlation between the slope and the intercept.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a density plot of the random effects from your final model.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a caterpillar plot of the random effects. Is there any person that seems odd in terms of a large standard errors around intercept and slope estimates?</p></li>
</ol>
