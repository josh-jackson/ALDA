<p>This homework introduces you to brms. Because I want you to feel comfortable with the software first we will be reanalyzing past datasets that were done within <code>lme4</code>.</p>
<p>Please send an email and Rmd (and pdf) files to: <a href="mailto:Homewor.r53rwfxazn4wnxur@u.box.com" class="email">Homewor.r53rwfxazn4wnxur@u.box.com</a> due date is: 10/18</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Rerun one model from question #1 from homework #2 in brms. Compare the output with the lme4 model.</p></li>
<li><p>What are the priors on this model? Graph one of them and explain what the distributions means about what you expect to happen.</p></li>
<li><p>Get the posterior samples into a dataframe. What does this dataframe contain? To answer describe why are there the number of rows there, why that many columns? What do each of the columns represent?</p></li>
<li><p>Graph the distribution of random effects of the slope parameter. Interpret what this graph tells you.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the default priors of this model to something that a) regularizes the model and b) that does the opposite, one that is wildly wrong/optomostic about the effects. What happens in each of these models?</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce a covariate to the model. Run the new model and empirically comapre the fit of the model to the model you ran in #1.</p></li>
</ol>
