LDA basics Goals This first class is set to orientate you to the world of longitudinal data and MLM models.\n Motivation, terms, concepts Why longitudinal? At least 7 reasons:\nIdentification of intraindividual change (and stability). Do you increase or decrease with time or age. Is this pattern monotonic? Should this best be conceptualized as a stable process or something that is more dynamic? On average how do people change?\n Inter-individual differences in intraindividual change. Does everyone change the same? Do some people start higher but change less? Do some increase while some decrease?\n Examine joint relationship among intraindividual change for two or more constructs. If variable X goes up does variable Y also go up across time? Does this always happen or only during certain times? Is this association due to a third variable or does it mean that change occurs for similar reasons?\n Determinants of intraindividual change. What are the repeated experiences that can push construct X around. Do these have similar effects at all times?\n Determinants of interindividual differences in intraindividual change. Do events, background characteristics, interventions or other between person characteristic shape why certain people change while others don’t?\n Inter-individual differences in intraindividual fluctuation and determinants of intraindividual fluctuation. Does everyone vary the same? Why are some more variable than others?\n Are there different classes/populations/mixtures of intraindividual change?\n   Types of change (most common) There are many ways to think of change and stability. We will only have time to go into a few of these types, but it is helpful to think about what type you are interested in when you plan a project or sit down to analyze data.\nDifferential / rank order consistency/ rank order stability. Goes by many names but in the end it is just a correlation. This is a group/sample/population level variable and indexes the relative standing of a person with regard to the rest o f the members in the sample. Does not take into account mean structure. Best used with heterotypic continuity where the construct may be the same but the measurement of the construct changes e.g., childhood IQ or acting out in school versus when you are an adult.  A specialized case of this is ipsative change, which looks at the rank order of constructs within a person. This is not done on a single variable (depression) but on a broad number of them (all PD symptoms).\nMean level/ absolute change. Takes into account mean structure and indexes absolute levels of a construct. A strong assumption is that the construct means (not a pun) the same thing across time. That is, my measure of depression is interpreted the same for a 40 year old and a 90 year old if I want to look at absolute differences between the two ages.  Mean level change is not dependent at all on rank order consistency. Can have no mean level change and high rank order consistency and vice versa.\nIndividual differences in change. Rank order and mean level provide an index of change and or stability for the sample. Here this provides an assessment of change for an individual. For example, if it is typical to decline in cognitive ability do some people buck the trend and stay at their past level? Individual differences in change get at both mean level changes as well as the tendency of the sample to show stability. It is the type of change that we will focus on the most.   Between person versus within person Or in other words these are the shortened version of interindividaul differences in change versus intraindividaul differences in change. Refers to across people versus within a particular person. Often we are interested in both simultaneously. Related to Level 1 and Level 2 (for those of you familiar with this terminology).\nWe may be interested in understanding only between person variability, within person variability or both. When trying to understand within person variability it is typically the case that predictors of between person effects are constant (between person) variables (e.g., gender) that does not change from assessment to assessment. In contrast, within person variability is best understood by time varying predictors (within person variables e.g., daily mood). We will incorporate both time invariant (between person) and time varying (within person) predictors into our eventual model.\n Trajectories, curves, change, growth… oh my How do we refer to ‘change’? Usually it is easier to refer to pictorially or in terms of an equation. Putting a word onto it usually causes some confusion, which is why there are a lot of redundant terms in the literature. All of these might refer to the same thing when used within a model. However, the names of some models use these terms differently and thus can refer to different models or conditions that you are working with. In this class I will try to point out the important differences but you will be fine if you supplement your terms with graphs or equations. Math is the great equalizer.\n Modeling frameworks: MLM \u0026amp; SEM In this class (and in the field) two primary techniques are used with longitudinal models: MLM and SEM. At some levels they are completely equivalent. At others, one is better than the other and vice versa.\nMLM/HLM is a simple extension of standard regression models. As a result it is easy to interpret and implement. In terms of longitudinal data it is easier to run models when the time of measurement differs from person to person. For this class we will use lme4 and brms as our MLM program but there are many others we could use e.g., nlme.\nSEM is related to regression in that regression is a subset of SEM techniques. In other words, an SEM program could run a simple regression analysis.\nThe primary advantage of MLM is that you may have assessment waves that vary in length between participants. An assumption of SEM models is that everyone has the same amount of time between assessment waves (though this assumption can be relaxed). MLM is also better suited for complex error structures and complex nesting above and beyond assessments within person. It is also easier to model interactions. Currently, it is easier to do MLM within a Bayesian framework too.\nSEM primary advantage is the ability to account for measurement error via latent assessment of the repeated measures. Other advantages include the ability to model multiple DVs at once, and do so in a flexible manner to look at, for example, the associations between change in one construct and change in the another (though these are also possible with MLMs). Another major advantage is the ability to look at latent groups via latent class or mixture models.\nBottom line: MLM is probably best suited for “basic” or “standard” growth models. More complex analyses of change with multiple variables would benefit from an SEM approach. This is also an oversimplification.\nMeaningful time metric Time is the most important part of longitudinal analyses. Without some sort of explicit operationalization of time or thought into how you handle time in your analyses you are not conducting longitudinal analyses. The key to interpreting your output is to know how you handled your time variable. What units is it in? Does everyone have the same differences between assessments? Is time something you are explicitly interested in or merely there as a means to collect repeated measures? We will discuss more of these as the semester progresses. Right now however an important distinction is what should the scale of our x-axis variable, time, be in?\nAt one level, the distinction is relevant to what is the process that is changing someone? Is it a naturally occurring developmental process? Then maybe age is the best metric. What about tracking child’s cognitive ability, something that might be influenced by level of schooling? Here grade may be more important than age. Another common metric is time in study. This may be useful if you are running an intervention or if you want to put everyone on the same starting metric and then control for nuisance variables like age or schooling level. Similarly, year of study as a prime time candidate may be useful if you are working from panel studies and interested in historical events and or cohort effects. As seen above, a wave variable (ie study measurement occasion) may be good enough to use as a time metric (though this makes some assumptions about the regularity of assessments both within and across people).\nDepending on your choice of time metric you may see different rates of change and variability in change. For psychological applications the most common would be age and time in study (followed by grades for assessments of kids). Age is nice because it captures a number of developmental processes thought to drive change (maturation, history, time-in-study) but does not identify a single reason. Time in study is the opposite in that it does not index any other type of change but that simplicity aides in testing different reasons for change (e.g, age moderation). Thus choosing one type of time metric will naturally guide the types of questions you are able to address.\n  Graphing ## Install package \u0026quot;strengejacke\u0026quot; from GitHub (`devtools::install_github(\u0026quot;strengejacke/strengejacke\u0026quot;)`) to load all sj-packages at once! library(ggplot2) library(tidyverse) ## ── Attaching packages ───────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.2.1.9000 ── ## ✔ tibble 2.1.3 ✔ dplyr 0.8.3 ## ✔ tidyr 0.8.99.9000 ✔ stringr 1.4.0 ## ✔ readr 1.3.1 ✔ forcats 0.4.0 ## ✔ purrr 0.3.2 ## ── Conflicts ───────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## ✖ dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag()   Putting it together example Using some resting state imaging data\ngg1 \u0026lt;- ggplot(example, aes(x = week, y = SMN7, group = ID)) + geom_point() print(gg1) ## Warning: Removed 9 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

Doing this with MLM These regressions are how you should begin to think about longitudinal data analysis. These growth models (the simplest form of longitudinal data analysis) are just a bunch of regressions for each person plus a little extra stuff. MLM is just a fancy regression equation. That is it. Seriously.\nWhat is different from normal regression? Extra error terms, mostly. For regression, we think of error as existing in one big bucket. For MLMs (and other longitudinal models) we will be breaking up unexplained variance (error) into multiple buckets.\nThis is where fixed effects and random effects come into play. We will discuss this more next class, but the gist is that fixed effects are the regression coefficients you are used to. Fixed effects index group level change. Random effects vary among individuals (in the longitudinal models we are talking about) and index variation from the group. For our purposes this is most easily seen thinking about an average group trajectory (fixed effect) and the random effect indexes how much variability there is around that group level effect.\n  Design considerations Number of assessment waves Remember high school algebra: two points define a line. But, that assumes we can measure constructs without error. Three assessment points will better define changes in psychological variables. As a default, you need three waves of data to use MLM models. However, some simplifications can be made with MLM. Two wave assessments are mostly better with SEM approaches.\n Measurement Scale of measurement Measurement is always the basis for good quantiative analysis. Without good measurement you are just spitting into the wind. Standard measurement concerns remain (reliability, dimensionality) but extra concerns exist with longitudinal data.\nWhat does it mean for categorical variables to change over time? Can you imagine a trajectory for what this is measuring? How would dichotomous responses impact ability to measure change?\nWhat about ranks, such as in preference for school subjects? What if the class composition changes – what is this assessing? Given that ranks are related such that if I increase someone has to decrease, how does that impact change assessments?\nCan I analyze childhood and adult variables simultaneously if assess the same construct, even though they may be measured differently? How can you measure change in the same construct but with different measures?\nOften the answer to these is to use a different form of longitudinal model. In general, the better measured the construct (continuous, not dependent on others, using the same scale) the more complex/sophisticated analysis you can run. Worse measurment leads to simplification both in terms of the models and the types of conclusions you can make.\n Standardizing It is standard practice to z-score to get standardized responses. However, it is not straight forward to do so when using longitudinal data. Why would z-scoring your variables be problematic?\nIf you scale for age, for example, this takes out a potential explanatory variable. Or, more worriesome, it also can add error if not everyone is standardized consistently (say if standardization is across age groups and someone just misses a cut).\nThe best reason though is that you take away the mean such that the expected change across time is zero. While helpful for cross sectional analyses, z-scoring adds in layers of computational and interpretational problems.\n Reliability The goal of longitudinal analyses is to understand why some construct changes or stays the same across time. A major difficulty in addressing this goal is whether you are able to accurately assess the construct of interest. One of the key characteristics (but not the only characteristic) is whether or not your assessment would be consistent if you gave an alternative measure or if you retook it immediately after your first assessment. This is known as reliability of measurement. To the extent that your measure is reliable it assesses true score variance as opposed to error variance. The amount of error score variance assessed is important given that error variance will masquerade as change across time given that error can correlate with anything else. The more error in your measurement the more change you will find. Of course this is unreliable change – change that is not true change, just stochastic noise.\nWe can think of reliability two ways. First, reliability of the change estimate. This, depend on how much error there is in the assessment and the number of waves. These two components are similar to inter item correlation and number of items being the two main components that effect reliability in cross sectional analyses.\n Measurement invariance The second way to think of reliability is in terms of how consistently the measure is assessed across time. Or do you assess the same construct at each time? What would happen if we looked at change in IQ from 1st grade to 12 grade and used the first grade IQ test at each time? The construct that you assessed at the first wave is likely not the same assessed later. To test this formally is called measurement invariance and is typically done through SEM. We will talk more about this later in the semester.\n   Threats to validity Missing data Types of missing data On a scale from 1 to you’re completely screwed, how confident are you that the missingness is not related to your study variables?\nMissing completely at random (MCAR) means that the missingness pattern is due entirely to randomness\nMissing at random (MAR) means that there is conditional randomness. Missingness may be due to other variables in the dataset. Pretty standard for longitudinal data.\nNot missing at random (NMAR) means that the missingness is systematic based on the missing values and not associated with measures variables. For example, in a study of reading ability, kids with low reading ability drop out, due to not liking to take tests on reading ability. However, if reading ability is associated with other variables in the model, then this missingness becomes closer in kind of MAR, and thus somewhat less problematic.\nTypically, we make the assumption we are working under MAR and thus we will have unbiased estimates when predictors of missingness are incorporated into the model.\nThere are tests to distinguish MAR from NMAR but you cannot distinguish MCAR from MAR because it is based entirely on knowing something that you dont have.\n How to handle missing data Listwise? Nah\nFull information maximum likelihood and other ML approaches? Sure. Multiple imputation? Cannot hurt. More on these approaches later.\n  Attrition/Mortality Major contributor to missing data\n History/cohort Know that the processes driving change can be due to a specific event or cohort.\n Maturation Change may occur because of natural processes. Thus if you just follow someone across time they will likely change irregardless of say, if they are in the control group.\n Testing Having people take the same survey, test or interview multiple times may lead them to respond differently. Does that change result from development or does it result from them being familiar with the test?\n Selection If you are looking at life events, know that life events are not distributed randomly. Moreover, people who stay in studies and even sign up for studies are different from those that do not. As a result, it is often hard to make internally valid inferences with longitudinal data.\n  Why not RM ANOVA? Cannot handle missing data\n Assumes rate of change is the same for all individuals.\n Time is usually done with orthogonal polynomials, making it difficult to interpret or to model non-linear. In other words, you have flexibility on how you want to model time.\n Accounting for correlation across time uses up many parameters, MLM is more efficient.\n Can accommodate differences in time between assessment waves across participants\n Handles various types of predictors - continuous vs nominal \u0026amp; static vs dynamic\n  Bottom line: this is an old way of doing these analyses with no upside. Don’t do them.\n  ","date":1567036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567036800,"objectID":"b6a3cdd8068a432e668db64269b4f199","permalink":"/lectures/02-lda-basics/","publishdate":"2019-08-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/lectures/02-lda-basics/","section":"Lectures","summary":"LDA basics","tags":null,"title":"Week 1","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" Please take a look at the syllabus for important class details.\nAny updates or announcements to the class will be found here on the main page.

In normal regression we wouldn’t think about this as everyone datapoint is assumed to be independent. However, this is not the case here. Failing to distinguish would lead to violation of independence, an important assumption of the standard regression model.\nAs seen in the graph above, what we have now is both individual level slopes as well as an average level slope. The average level slope is going to be the average of the individual level slopes, which will look like our average slope ignoring all dependencies. Same for the intercept.\nOne way to do this is to run seperate regressions for each person. Then we could just pool together where people start and how much they change to get the average intercept (starting value) and trajectory (how much people change).\n## Joining, by = \u0026quot;ID\u0026quot; regressions \u0026lt;- example2 %\u0026gt;% group_by(ID) %\u0026gt;% do(tidy(lm(SMN7 ~ week, data = .))) head(regressions) ## # A tibble: 6 x 6 ## # Groups: ID [3] ## ID term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 67 (Intercept) 0.0921 0.0161 5.72 0.0292 ## 2 67 week 0.00662 0.00657 1.01 0.420 ## 3 75 (Intercept) 0.126 NaN NaN NaN ## 4 75 week 0.00771 NaN NaN NaN ## 5 87 (Intercept) 0.0787 NaN NaN NaN ## 6 87 week -0.0227 NaN NaN NaN In addition to the intercept and the trajectory there is also the amount of variation around each of these estimates. Do people tend to change the same? Are there individual differences in the initial assessment?\nThis type of meaningful variation is lost when we have a between subjects only model that ignores the individual level. This variation will be called Random Effects (or variance estimates in SEM).\nNote, there is another important sournce of variation different from standard regression models. The within-subjects error that can be seen in the below graph. If we did not take people into account and just collapsed across people to get a between subjects assessment of change, this error would be confounded with individual differences in change. We will discuss this error more in depth later.\nexample3 \u0026lt;- example2 %\u0026gt;% filter(ID == \u0026quot;67\u0026quot;)  gg4 \u0026lt;- ggplot(example3, aes(x = week, y = SMN7, group = ID)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = \u0026quot;lm\u0026quot;) gg4 Thinking about random effects  Random effects Within subjects variability in either staring value or slope/trajectory is referenced in terms of random effects. How do we represent this in our equation? Easy, we just say that the typical regression parameters we have are not the same for everyone – that they are random (in contrast to fixed).\nIn general, when would we want to use random effects? If there is some sort of selection (random or not) of many possible values of the predictor (e.g., stimuli are 3 random depression drugs, three semi random chosen levels of a drug). With longitudinal data this is (random) people.\nSide bar: Even in situations where these levels are not random (eg working with states) it is still useful to use MLM and we still call them random effects. To be consistent with language, random here can refer to as random from the population average, not randomly selected. When talking about “random effects” you can mean either of these defintions (and a few more). Luckily we can mostly ignore these semantic issues.\nWhat is necessary for modeling random effects? For longitudinal models, there needs to be multiple assessments per your grouping category (people, schools, neighborhoods).\nWe are assuming these random effects are sampled from some population and thus vary from group to group (or person to person). This means that your coeffients (like traditional regression coefficients) are estimates of some population parameter and thus have error associated with them. This error is not like like a standard residual, which represents error for your overall model. Nor is it like the standard error for a point estimate. Random effects can best be thought of as deviation of individual regression lines from the group regression line (though it technically is not this).\nTo facilitate the multiple assessments per person we will now use both i and j subscripts. We will see that the random effects are part of the overall error term in the model. Counterintutitively, the main focus of these types of models will be the fixed effects, with less attention paid to the random effects. That said, the random effects are necessary to account for dependency in the data. One can think about these models as normal fixed effects regressions, with the random effects there to account for the longitudinal nature of the data. They are made up of a number of standard regression equations, each for a single individual. Doing so side steps the trouble of having correlated errors, and thus allows us to interpret our findings without concern.\nTo faciliate adding random effects to our model it is helpful to think about two “levels” to our regression equation. The first level will be the within-person model, in that it described how people differ across time. The second level will be the between person level. Note that these do not correspond to fixed or random effects. Instead they can be thought to model either within person differences or between person differences. Mastering thinking at these two levels will help make sense of these MLM models.\n Empty model equation Let’s start with the most basic model and then expand from there.\nLevel 1 - within person \\[ {Y}_{ij} = \\beta_{0j} +\\varepsilon_{ij} \\]\nNote that we have multiple responses per individual j, noted with an i to refer to specific times.\nAlso note that the intercept has a subscript. In typical regression it does not. This suggests that not everyone has the same intercept.\nThe residuals at this level are thought of as measurment error OR as something that can be explained by time varying predictors.\nLevel 2 - between person \\[ {\\beta}_{0j} = \\gamma_{00} + U_{0j} \\]\nLevel 2 takes the intercept (or other parameter) at level 1 and breaks it down into an equation for each individual, j. An overall group average (the gamma) and a residual term specific to deviation around the intercept (see below).\nAnd two variance components: 1. a random effect of the intercept \\[ {U}_{0j} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\tau_{00}^{2}) \\] The subscript of the \\(U_{0j}\\) refers to the number of the parameter where 0 is the intercept, 1 is the first regression coefficient, and so on. The second refers to the individual, j.\nThis random effect is normally distributed with a mean of zero and a variance of \\(\\tau\\)\nthe residual error term \\[ {R}_{ij} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^{2}) \\] Much like in normal regression there is an error term for all of the variation we cannot account for. What is unique here is that we took that normal variation and split it into two components. One that is attributable to variation around the intercept \\({U}_{0j}\\) and a catch all residual.  Technically this is not a growth model, nor one that is inherently longitudinal. However, it does serve as a nice starting point to identify random effects.\n Putting it together \\[ {Y}_{ij} = \\gamma_{00} + U_{0j} + \\varepsilon_{ij} \\]\n ICC ICC:\n\\[\\frac{U_{0j}}{U_{0j}+ \\varepsilon_{ij}}\\]\n % variation between vs within person variance.    Adding time Here is the basic growth model where our predictor is a time variable\nLevel 1:\n\\[ {Y}_{ij} = \\beta_{0j} + \\beta_{1j}X_{ij} + \\varepsilon_{ij} \\]\nNote how similar this looks like to a normal regression equation. Again, the differences are due to those pesky subscripts. Like before, think of this as a normal regression equation at the level of a person. Each person would have one of these equations with, in addition to a unique Y, X and residual, a unique \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}\\). Look above to those individaul regressions we did at the start of this section.\nLevel 2:\n\\[ {\\beta}_{0j} = \\gamma_{00} + U_{0j}\\]\nLevel 2 takes the parameters at level 1 and decomposes them into a fixed component that reflects that average and then the individual deviations around that fixed effect. \\(U_{0j}\\) is not error in the traditional sense. It describes how much variation there is around that parameter. Do some people start higher while some start lower, for example.\n\\[ {\\beta}_{1j} = \\gamma_{10} \\]\nThe new level 2 term refers to the first predictor in the level 1 regression equation ie the slope. This slope is fixed in that the level 2 equation only has a gamma term and no U residual term.\nPutting it together: \\[ {Y}_{ij} = \\gamma_{00} + \\gamma_{10} (X_{1j})+ U_{0j} + \\varepsilon_{ij} \\]\nNote that in computing a single individuals Y, it depends on the two fixed effects, the Xj, and the random effect for the intercept.\nWhat does this look like graphically? And how does this differ from the random intercept model?\nWhat does this look like graphically?\nCan you draw out the sources of error? The random effects for each participant? The fixed effects?\n Adding a random slope? What happens when we add a random slope? Level 1:\n\\[ {Y}_{ij} = \\beta_{0j} + \\beta_{1j}X_{1j} + \\varepsilon_{ij} \\] Level 2:\n\\[ {\\beta}_{0j} = \\gamma_{00} + U_{0j}\\]\n\\[ {\\beta}_{1j} = \\gamma_{10} + U_{1j} \\]\n\\[ {Y}_{ij} = \\gamma_{00} + \\gamma_{10}(X_{ij})+ U_{0j} + U_{1j}(X_{ij}) + \\varepsilon_{ij} \\]\nCan think of a persons score divided up into a fixed component as well as the random component.\nThese random effects are likely related to one another. For example, if someone starts high on a construct they are then less likely to increase across time. This negative correlation can be seen in the residual structure, where the random effects are again normally distributed with a mean of zero, but this time one must also consider covariance in addition to variance.\n\\[ \\begin{pmatrix} {U}_{0j} \\\\ {U}_{1j} \\end{pmatrix} \\sim \\mathcal{N} \\begin{pmatrix} 0, \u0026amp; \\tau_{00}^{2} \u0026amp; \\tau_{01}\\\\ 0, \u0026amp; \\tau_{01} \u0026amp; \\tau_{10}^{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\]\nNote that it is possible to have a different error structure, one where there is no relationship between the intercept and the slope. We will discuss this more later in the semester. Right now just know that the default is to have correlated random effects.\nWe also have the within subject variance term that accounts for deviations that are not accounted for by time variable and other level 1 predictors.\n\\[ {R}_{ij} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^{2}) \\]\nNote that it is possible to model these level 1 residuals with different structures. This specification implies that there is no correlation across an individuals residuals, once you account for level 1 predictors (ie growth trajectories). Having a specific level 1 autoregressive or other type of pattern is common in other treatments of longitudinal models (panel models) but is not necessary with growth models (but possible).\nThis is the basic format of the growth model. It will be expanded later on by adding variables to the level 1 model and to the level 2 model. Adding to the level 1 model is only possible with repeated variables.\nLevel 1 regression coefficients are added to the level 2 model. These coefficients are decomposed into a fixed effect, a random effect (possibly), and between person predictors. As with any regression model, each of these only have a single error term.\n  Individaul level random effects Calculation of individaul level random effects Random effects are often thought in terms of variance components. We can see this if we think of individual level regressions for each person where we then have a mean and a variance for both the intercept or the slope. The greater the variance around the intercept and the slope means that not everyone starts at the same position and not everyone changes at the same rate.\nIf you want to look at a specific person’s random effect you can think of it as a deviation from the fixed effect where subject 6’s intercept can be thought of as\n\\[ {\\beta}_{06} = \\gamma_{00} \\pm U_{06}\\] e.g 2.2 = 3 - .8\n How are these random effects calculated? It isn’t as straightforward as calculating a slope for each person and then using the difference between that slope and the average slope. Instead, the estimates are partially pooled towards the overall mean of the sample, the fixed effect. We do this to get a better estimate of the parameters, the same way that using regression to predict y-hat given an X is better than binning X and calculating y-hat. More information = better.\nWhy not full pooling? Because it ignores individaul differences in change.\nThe result is that the variance of the change trajectories (using MLM) will be smaller than the variance of the fitted linear models.\n random effects and residual (standard) assumptions Joint normal distribution of random effects\nNormally distributed residual\nConstant variance over time\nRandom effects and residual are uncorrelated\nBoth have a mean of zero\nRandom effects and residual size will depend on predictors in the model.\n Random effect decomposition Think of the original total variance in a scatter plot of our DVs. Adding random effects takes that variance and trims it down.\nThe intercept only MLM seperates it into a level 1 variance (which at this stage is treated as error) and a level 2 random intercept variance.\nCreating a random slopes model takes the Level 1 residual variance and creates a new “pile” of explained variance.\n  working with models in R  Data analysis and data structures Wide and Long form Depending on what type of analysis you want to perform you may need to restructure your data. I recommend the combination of tidyr and dplyr (among others) to restructure and manage your dataframes. The first decision you need to make is whether you want your data structured in a long or a wide format. There are multiple names to refer to these two types: multivariate vs univariate, person-level vs person-period, etc but they all refer to the same idea. How to structure your data depends on both what level of analysis (individual, dyad, household) and what type of analyses (MLM/SEM). Typically our focus is on individuals.\nWide form is common among non-longitudinal data. It has one line per individual with all of their repeated measures in the same row, each with some name to distinguish which assessment wave the data came from. In general, this format is used for SEM.\n## # A tibble: 3 x 4 ## ID ext_1 ext_2 ext_3 ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 1 4 4 4 ## 2 2 6 5 4 ## 3 3 4 5 6 In contrast, long format has a row per observation. Thus, participants likely have many rows, each one referring to a different assessment wave. There are fewer variables in this format which makes organization somewhat easier. Thus this has been referred to as “Tidy” data. Graphing with ggplot is facilitated when using tidy data such as being in the long format.\n## # A tibble: 9 x 3 ## ID time ext ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 1 1 4 ## 2 1 2 4 ## 3 1 3 4 ## 4 2 1 6 ## 5 2 2 5 ## 6 2 3 4 ## 7 3 1 4 ## 8 3 2 5 ## 9 3 3 6 How do you go back and forth? We use the tidyr package! As of a few months ago, you would use the gather and the spread functions. Now these are being phased out and are being replaced by pivot_longer and pivot_wider. The functions work similar but the newer ones are a little more intuitive both in terms of remembering the correct function name as well as well adding more bells and whistles.\nGather and pivot_longer goes from wide to long.\nlibrary(tidyr) wide_to_long \u0026lt;- wide %\u0026gt;% gather(ext_1:ext_3,key = \u0026quot;time\u0026quot;, value = \u0026quot;ext\u0026quot;) wide_to_long ## # A tibble: 9 x 3 ## ID time ext ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 1 ext_1 4 ## 2 2 ext_1 6 ## 3 3 ext_1 4 ## 4 1 ext_2 4 ## 5 2 ext_2 5 ## 6 3 ext_2 5 ## 7 1 ext_3 4 ## 8 2 ext_3 4 ## 9 3 ext_3 6 library(tidyr) wide_to_long.p \u0026lt;- wide %\u0026gt;% pivot_longer(-ID, names_to = \u0026quot;time\u0026quot;, values_to = \u0026quot;ext\u0026quot;) wide_to_long.p ## # A tibble: 9 x 3 ## ID time ext ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 1 ext_1 4 ## 2 1 ext_2 4 ## 3 1 ext_3 4 ## 4 2 ext_1 6 ## 5 2 ext_2 5 ## 6 2 ext_3 4 ## 7 3 ext_1 4 ## 8 3 ext_2 5 ## 9 3 ext_3 6 Note the similarities. The key in all three is to 1. identify which columns need to be reshaped. Here is it all of them besides ID. 2. we need to name the newly created variable that consists of the old column names (here time). 3. we need to name what those values represent (here levels of extraversion)\nThe separate function could be used to get only the assessment wave number. This might be useful when combining data together or for creating a common time metric for everyone.\nwide_to_long2 \u0026lt;- wide_to_long %\u0026gt;% separate(time, into = c(\u0026quot;omit\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;wave\u0026quot;), sep = \u0026quot;_\u0026quot;, convert = TRUE) %\u0026gt;% dplyr::select(-omit) %\u0026gt;% arrange(ID) wide_to_long2 ## # A tibble: 9 x 3 ## ID wave ext ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 1 1 4 ## 2 1 2 4 ## 3 1 3 4 ## 4 2 1 6 ## 5 2 2 5 ## 6 2 3 4 ## 7 3 1 4 ## 8 3 2 5 ## 9 3 3 6 # Note that the seperate function will identify non numeric characters and use that to seperate the values. You can omit the sep = function to check yourself.  One issue that comes up here is that we have differing dates for each assessment. Ideally we would like to utilize that extra information.\n## # A tibble: 3 x 7 ## ID ext_1 ext_2 ext_3 date_1 date_2 date_3 ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 1 4 4 4 1/1/10 5/1/10 8/1/10 ## 2 2 6 5 4 1/6/10 4/10/10 9/1/10 ## 3 3 4 5 6 1/8/10 4/25/10 9/13/10 How do we fix it? The same way we would with multiple variables we want to convert. Wave, along with ID helps us keep track of what variables go with which person at which time. Together, the two serve as a unique identifier. To better understand the code go through each line to see what the intervening data frame looks like.\nlong.date \u0026lt;- wide.date %\u0026gt;% gather(-ID, key = \u0026quot;time\u0026quot;, value = \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% separate(time, into = c(\u0026quot;variable\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;wave\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% spread(variable,value) long.date ## # A tibble: 9 x 4 ## ID wave date ext ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 1 1 1/1/10 4 ## 2 1 2 5/1/10 4 ## 3 1 3 8/1/10 4 ## 4 2 1 1/6/10 6 ## 5 2 2 4/10/10 5 ## 6 2 3 9/1/10 4 ## 7 3 1 1/8/10 4 ## 8 3 2 4/25/10 5 ## 9 3 3 9/13/10 6 One difficulty of creating a wave variable is whether or not the variables are named in a manner such that 1) assessment wave is easily identifiable (e.g. does _a always refer to the first wave whereas _b always refer to the second?) and 2) if that is consistent across variables. Having a wave identifier for your variables is important/necessary. Having an easily selected one (ie at the end of the variable name, hopefully separated by an underscore or a period). If assessment wave separators are embedded within the variable name it will be harder to covert your data. Often, variable data is attached at the end of a name such as SWB_4 to refer to the fourth item in a scale. This may obscure wave identification as in SWB_A_4. A similar naming problem can occur with multiple reports e.g,. SWB_4_parent. I recommend putting wave identification last. The difficulties become partly moot when working in long format (read: entering data in) as opposed to wide.\nIn the above code we used spread to go from long to wide as a means of creating a long dataset where there were multiple variables. Technically this is not a tidy dataset in that it comprises of both long and wide information, but it is the typical format used for MLM analyses.\nGoing from long to wide uses spread or pivot_wider function. We will utilize this when converting our MLM models to SEM models, but try the code below to see what happens.\nlong_to_wide \u0026lt;- long %\u0026gt;% spread(time, ext) long_to_wide ## # A tibble: 3 x 4 ## ID `1` `2` `3` ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 1 4 4 4 ## 2 2 6 5 4 ## 3 3 4 5 6 Note that this is technically the dataframe format that we want. The problem is that our variable names are numeric. This often causes problems. When working with tibbles use backticks ’ to refer to the column e.g., select(‘1’)\n basic lmer code The basic function we will work with is lmer from the lme4 package\nlibrary(lme4) ## Loading required package: Matrix ## ## Attaching package: \u0026#39;Matrix\u0026#39; ## The following objects are masked from \u0026#39;package:tidyr\u0026#39;: ## ## expand, pack, unpack The package was developed to be similar to the lm function.

All additional fixed effects go outside the parentheses. Inside the parentheses are the random effects and residual terms. To the right of the vertical line is our level 1 residual term, which references the grouping variable. In this case, as with almost all longitudinal work, is the subject ID. To the left of the vertical line is the random effects we want to estimate. Right now this estimates only one random effect, one for the intercept.\nIt is possible to suppress a random intercept by putting a zero instead of a 1.

It may change because the intercept is now conditional on time ie after accounting for time. It is not the predicted outcome when time = 0. You can think of the previous intercept as the grand mean of person means. If our week variable here changed across time then there would be a larger change in the intercept.\nHow do you interpret week?\nHow did the random effects change?\nWhy treating time is so important Time with a different scale.

Uses a likelihood function that describes the probability of observing the sample data as a function of the parameters. Attempts to maximize the function.\nREML vs ML\nDifferences account for the fact that fixed effects are being estimated simultaously with th variance parameters. REML accounts for uncertainty in the fixed effects before estimating residual variance. REML attempts to maximize the likelihood of the residuals whereas ML the sample data.\nIf you use REML you should be careful in testing fixed effects against eachother (more down below)\n Testing significance (adapted from Ben Bolker) Methods for testing single parameters From worst to best:\nWald Z-tests. Easy to compute. However, they are asymptotic approximations, assuming both that (1) the sampling distributions of the parameters are multivariate normal and that (2) the sampling distribution of the log-likelihood is (proportional to) χ2. Wald t-tests Likelihood ratio test.\n Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or parametric bootstrap confidence intervals  P values are not included Authors are not convinced of the utility of the general approach of testing with reference to an approximate null distribution. In general, it is not clear that the null distribution of the computed ratio of sums of squares is really an F distribution, for any choice of denominator degrees of freedom. While this is true for special cases that correspond to classical experimental designs (nested, split-plot, randomized block, etc.), it is apparently not true for more complex designs (unbalanced, GLMMs, temporal or spatial correlation, etc.).\ntl;dr: it gets messy with more complex models\nIf you really want p values\n# library(lmerTest)  Likelhiood ratio test How much more likely the data is under a more complex model than under the simpler model (these models need to be nested to compare this).\nLog Likelihood (LL) is derived from ML estimation. Larger the LL the better the fit.\nDeviance compares two LLs. Current model and a saturated model (that fits data perfectly).\nDeviance = -2[LL current - LL saturated]\nLL saturated = 1 for MLMs (probability it will perfectly recapture data). log of 1 is 0. So this term drops out.\nDeviance = -2LL current model.\nComparing 2 models is called a likelihood ration test. Need to have: 1. same data 2. nested models (think of constraining a parameter to zero)\nDistributed as chi-square with df equal to constraint differences between models.\nmod.2r \u0026lt;- lmer(SMN7 ~ 1 + week + ( 1 | ID), data=example) summary(mod.2r) ## Linear mixed model fit by REML [\u0026#39;lmerMod\u0026#39;] ## Formula: SMN7 ~ 1 + week + (1 | ID) ## Data: example ## ## REML criterion at convergence: -675.4 ## ## Scaled residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -2.2308 -0.4868 -0.0377 0.4542 3.2337 ## ## Random effects: ## Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. ## ID (Intercept) 0.001815 0.04261 ## Residual 0.001300 0.03606 ## Number of obs: 216, groups: ID, 88 ## ## Fixed effects: ## Estimate Std.

The class will introduce the rationale of measuring change and stability over time to study phenomena, as well as how within-person designs can increase statistical power and precision compared to more traditional designs. Most the course will use multi-level models and latent (growth) curve models to specify patterns of change across time. Additional topics include: visualization, measurement invariance, time-to- event models and power. PREREQ: Use of R will be required, Familiarity with MLM and/or Structural Equation Models.\nClass textbook\nReadings will be provided\nStructure of class\nEach class will cover a specific type of longitudinal model. During that class, I will provide an overview of the important considerations or motivation for this analysis. This will take the first half of the class or a little longer. The final hour of class will be devoted to walking through code and results.\nGrading Grading consists of 3 aspects: 1. Weekly projects uploaded to github (70% of grade) 2. Final project covering the method and results of your main longitudinal hypothesis(es) (30%)\nSchedule\n    Week Date Topic Workshop Homework    1 8/29 Motivation, terms, concepts, and graphing Data Descriptives and plotting   2 9/5 Growth curve basics; MLM in R: packages and procedures tidyr   3 9/12 Conditional (Level 1 and 2 predictors) MLM models purrr   4 9/19 Polynomial, piecewise and spline models plotting redux   5 9/26 Three level and group models brms   6 10/03 Intensive data analysis/within person fluctuations p1    7 10/10 Intensive data analysis/within person fluctuations p2    8 10/17 SEM and simple path models    9 10/24 Latent Grown (curve) Models    10 10/31 MI and Second order Model    11 11/7 Multiple group models    12 11/14 Class canceled    13 11/21 Flexible SEM models (LCM, STATE-TRAIT; ALT-SR)    14 11/28 Tofurkey day    15 12/5 Mixture Models      Other topics: Longitudinal mediation (and multilevel mediation), two wave data, experimental approaches\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"4c565ba0724123eb589419cad7e99082","permalink":"/syllabus/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/syllabus/","section":"","summary":"Instructor: Joshua Jackson\nOffice: 315B\nOffice hours: 1-2 Wednesday and by appointment\nTA: Emorie Beck Office hours: TBD\nCourse Description\nThis course covers modern methods of handling longitudinal, repeated measures.
